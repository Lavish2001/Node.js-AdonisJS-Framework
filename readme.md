# Nodejs-AdonisJS-Framework-Project-

This is a Node.js CRUD Application Project which is made up on AdonisJS Framework.


## Why Nodejs-AdonisJS-Framework 🤔

- AdonisJS is a Node.js web application framework designed for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and is heavily inspired by Laravel, a PHP web framework. 

- AdonisJS provides a powerful and flexible environment for building APIs, and supports multiple database drivers including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. It has a built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Lucid that simplifies database interactions, and provides a variety of authentication strategies and security features to help protect your application.

- In addition to these core features, AdonisJS also supports GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, and the server to respond with only that data. This improves the efficiency of API responses, reducing the amount of data transferred between client and server and improving overall performance.

- Git clone -> npm install -> Project is ready to use.
